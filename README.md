To build my program, enter "make" in the command line. This will build the executable "httpserver". Enter "httpserver", followed by the IP address of the HTTP server to contact, and then a port number above 1024. You also must enter the -a flag followed by a mapping file name. This will be persistent throughout runs of the server. Additionally, you have the option to enable logging and/or specify the number of threads. To enable logging, use the flag -l "logfile", which will create a log file called logfile. To specify the number of threads, use the flag -N 'x', where x will be the number of threads. If -l is not use, there will be no logging and if -N is not used, the default number of threads will be 4. These flags may be anywhere after ./httpserver on the command line. Then, in another terminal, enter a patch request to add an alias to a resource name and then enter a get or put request using curl. For example, for get, enter curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8888/blah --request-target ABCDEFarqdeXYZxyzf012345-ab, and for put, enter curl -s -T my_local_file http://127.0.0.1:8888/blah --request-target ABCDEFarqdeXYZxyzf012345-ab. This will run the program.
